              <h4>Open Ecosystem</h4>
              <p>
                The aim of the OPEN TRUST FABRIC alliance is to create an open and inclusive ecosystem of contributors 
                who will demonstrate an innovative approach for both reporting the economy as an ecosystem of contracts 
                and actually implementing it, connecting the legal, accounting and business functions into a united system, 
                interfacing between these three worlds.

              <h4>Global Community</h4>
              <p>The global community will provide a clear vision of the convergence of economy, law and code, 
                and the representation of the global economy as an ecosystem of contracts.</p>

              <h4>Code-ified Law</h4>
              <p>The OPEN TRUST FABRIC alliance will map current contracts and data linked in a way that facilitates 
                a new approach to regulation, which involves an increasing use of software code and code-ified law. 
                We will begin by placing law in the context of transacting.</p>

                <h4>Graph of Semantically-labelled Data</h4>
                <p>
                    The approach is similar to those that leading-edge enterprises are beginning to adopt – 
                    a “graph” of semantically-labelled data, organised into secure “data lakes,” 
                    with cryptographic access control and assurances of coherence across suppliers, customers, managers 
                    and regulators, based on standards and open source software. In essence, we will demonstrate that 
                    entire economies can be modelled in the way that leading enterprises are modelling their own commercial 
                    relationships. We will also demonstrate data minimization approaches that will enable a more 
                    robust, secure, localised solution to online transacting and “trust,” consistent with 
                    the EU GDPR objectives an initiatives such as the “Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace”.

                <h4>Consolidation and Standardization</h4>
                <p>We will capture and communicate interoperability requirements and issues, and document 
                  usage-related operational constraints, standards and virtualization issues associated 
                  with contracts and seek to identify opportunities for consolidation and standardization 
                  that could facilitate operational modelling, framework adoption and improvement in 
                  contracting.

                <h4>Open Innovative Repository</h4>
                <p>We will jointly create an open innovative repository based on a set of community-driven 
                  Web tools to promote the vision of available contract ecosystem "as a living organism." 
                  A part of maintaining robustness is keeping the tools simple and open source so that 
                  autonomy and diversity can be maintained. Ideally, the efficiency will be realized from 
                  grass-roots use (technically, the “edge”). That is one of the advantages of focusing on 
                  tools that let people write and manage conventional contract documents more efficiently. 
                  This approach is focused on the “parameters” and “prose” elements of “Ricardian Contracts.”

                        The speed and velocity of economic cycles, secured by current legal systems, is suffering from 
                        the usage of slow legal practises and low-tech methods, creating bottlenecks to economic processes 
                        and allowing unknown risks to develop. Traditional legal processes lag behind today’s 
                        virtualisation/tokenization of the economic system, trading and operational practices. 
                        The technology has run faster than the law, the original warning in Professor Lawrence Lessig’s 
                        “Code is Law”.

                      <p>Although legal professionals are surrounded by digital information and software tools, 
                        the way they codify and represent contracts is still limited by the first wave of word processing 
                        tools that limit the possibility to represent digital knowledge and embed data, connected to accounting 
                        principles and procedures. The digitization of information, the possibility to bring automation into 
                        decision making processes, the incorporation of legal rules into code and the emergence of regulation 
                        by code could favour a paradigm shift to eliminate barriers for making legal constructs more effective 
                        and predictable.

                      <p>Opaque and ineffective legal document practices are responsible for a very large part of 
                        the cost of doing business, the opacity of governments, hidden systemic risks and the trend 
                        toward gigantism and winner-take-most in online business. Nearly all of the inefficiency, costs 
                        and opacity of forming and managing legal relationships can be eliminated by adopting practices 
                        that are already well-established in the open source software community. Software engineers have 
                        perfected these methods for their own use; lawyers can adopt and adapt them.

                      <p>Similarly, the clarity and certainty of legal arrangements can be radically increased by 
                        “codification” of legal documents. Codification is perhaps the most ancient and 
                        effective legal method for increasing clarity and certainty, from Hammurabi and 
                        the Napoleonic Code to INCO terms. From “my” forms of businesses and agencies to model documents, 
                        industry standards and legislation, codification promotes clarity and stability. 
                        These various forms of codification can be integrated into a single system as open source templates. 
                        The templates can be commented, rated and annotated like legal codes. They can also be adapted (“forked”) 
                        and integrated (“merged”) in a transparent, on-going process.

                      <p>Technology trends put increasing focus on the importance of legal templates. 
                        A vast multiplicity of solutions exist and new ones are being proposed to improve 
                        automation of transacting, from legal aid “bots” to court interfaces, contract 
                        management and vendor management, to smart contracts and blockchains. Each has 
                        its idiosyncrasies, and each depends on standardising legal text.

                      <p>A simple, general approach can unify all of these efforts around the shared necessity 
                        of legal text that frames transactions. The approach can work with conventional legal document 
                        practices of word processing, with corporate systems of contract management and with 
                        new blockchain systems of smart contracts.

                      <p>In parallel, economic measurement approaches, particularly Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 
                        struggle to account for today’s intangible assets—services, insights, and networks. 
                        This is not merely because the way of measuring GDP and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) 
                        are no longer adequate methods for measuring economic growth. Those methodologies need to be updated 
                        to reflect new contract structures that could facilitate and make measurable and visible 
                        the way networks and intangible assets and data should be correctly accounted in a computable, 
                        standards-based ledger of value.
