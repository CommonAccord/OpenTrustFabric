"Fiduciary" is used here in a very specific way.  We mean the persons that provide services and products to support transacting.  In an ecosystem of contracting, we can (artificially) divide persons into roles of producers, consumers and fiduciaries.<br>

Producers include everyone who provides services or products in the "real" economy.  Farmers, artisans, manufacturers, care-givers are "producers" in this vision.<br>

Consumers include anyone in their role as the beneficiary of services or products.  It includes people in their role as citizens and guests.<br>

Fiduciaries create and maintain the system of transacting.  "Fiduciaries" includes many application developers and software companies, lawyers, help-desk staff, telcos, shipping companies and others.<br>
