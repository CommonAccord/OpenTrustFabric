<p>A "Data Fiduciary" is a person who holds data on behalf of another person.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of data fiduciaries, including lawyers, trustees, government agencies, merchants and banks.  In the digital age, data has proliferated and many persons now collect and hold data.  This has resulted in new powers, new concerns and new dangers.  There are efforts to address these problems, notably the EU's General Data Protection Regulation.</p>

<p>Legislation is a necessary but inadequate tool for addressing this problem.  It is necessary to control bad actors.  It is inadequate because legislation is necessarily a blunt instrument and is confined to the jurisdiction of the legislature, while the solution must be both respectful of local preferences and globally respected. See, e.g. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/06/05/rulemaking-and-its-discontents-moving-from-principle-to-practice-in-federal-privacy-legislation/">Rulemaking and its Discontents</a></p>

<p>"Contract" is how most of data protection is currently articulated.  Privacy policies, terms of use, non-disclosure documents and the like are connected by data sharing agreements. An ecosystem of contracts based on standards could make this data infrastructure much less leaky and opaque, balancing it better in the interest of the data subjects.</p>

<p>"Fiduciary duty" <a href="https://thelivinglib.org/data-fiduciary/">has been suggested</a> as a general principle under which the duties of data holders can be designed.  We have adopt that language. The original authors used the term "information fiduciary."  We intend the same thing by "data," which is a shorter word.

<p>Data fiduciaries come in many varieties.  Some have relatively simple roles, such as a service that forwards mail.  Some have very complex roles such as lawyers, who must make subtle judgments about the use of client confidences in advocating for the client.  We suggest that institutions regulated as "banks" will have a special role.  "Banks" hold extremely sensitive information about very large numbers of people for very long periods.  They are privy to nearly all transactions that involve payments other than cash. The EU's Payment Services Directive now requires all European banks to open up interfaces. Banks are key institutions in data management.</p>
