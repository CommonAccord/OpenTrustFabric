"Pattern Fiduciaries" are persons who provide code, text, applications, designs or other paradigms for transacting.  This includes software applications for creating or managing transactions, legal document models, accounting software, and their components.<p>

In a Ricardian view, the basic elements of a contract or contract system are (and):
<ol class="secs-and"><li>Code<li>Prose<li>Database<li>Access Control</ol>

There are rather few pure Pattern Fiduciaries.  Most providers of Code or Prose blend those into broader offerings.  Coders propose applications, often with data storage and other services connected to the offering.  Lawyers produce contract Prose but usually as part of a broader service.  Businesses and agencies have model forms but as part of transacting with them.<p>

Nevertheless, there are some examples of pure Prose and Code offerings and we project that these will become pervasive in an Open Trust Fabric.  There is a long tradition of contract forms being available (sometimes for a fee).  The advent of the blockchain movement has created an explosion of pure providers of Code for transacting.  The basic mechanics of internet interaction have long been developed in open source.  The critical element of software for authentication and access control is available in open source.  So are databases, conventional, decentralized and graph.  Some of the blockchain offerings now have matching Code and Prose, as well as databases.<p>

We project that all of these pure forms will become available via the standard platforms for open source collaboration, notably on sites such as GitHub and GitLab.<p>

In making this list, our goal is to be very broad.  A first cut at a list includes:

<ol><li>Code<li>Model legal documents<li>Designs</ol>
