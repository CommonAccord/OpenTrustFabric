<p>
A "Decision Fiduciary" is a person who makes decisions on behalf of another person.</p>
<p>The paradigm of a Decision Fiduciary is a judge or arbitrator, or head of government. But decision fiduciaries include administrators, parents, advisors and others also make decisions.</p>
<p>There is a crisis in decision-making in the modern era.  The scale of institutions and needs of modern economies have resulted in many very important decisions being made very far from the persons involved, with the attending lack of detailed information or experience of the consequences.  This is sometimes characterized as lack of "skin in the game,"" but can also be understood as a problem of connection, engagement or empathy.</p>
<p>Standards can reduce the scale needed for efficient management of information and therefore the scale of the organization needed to support effective decision-making. This is particularly true if experience and wisdom can be shared across decision-makers without compromise of data security.  Standards enable that, as do technical solutions such as algorithm-to-the-data.</p>
<o>One objective of an Open Trust Fabric is to enable more proximate, situationally-embedded persons to make well-informed decisions on behalf of others.</p>
<p>A list of types of decision-makers would include:</p>
<ol><li>Governments and agencies</li><li>Legislatures</li>Judges and arbitrators</li><li>Complaints departments</li><li>Agents and advisors</li></ol>
