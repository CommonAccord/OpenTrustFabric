"Who" is a category for "persons."  Persons for our purposes includes individuals ("Human") and legal persons such as corporations, partnerships and government agencies ("Entity").  It also includes persons acting via an account, such as a bank account or membership ("Persona").<br><br>

Currently, here we have "/Fiduciary/" where we catalog the four kinds of fiduciaries.
