Taxonomies:

This is intended as a list of relevant taxonomies and standards.

The second requirement for an effective ecosystem of contracts is common taxonomies - labels that map to meanings.  Data points should have common names, they must be clearly mapped to the kind of contract and the contracts must be mapped to common meanings.  A graph of Prose Objects provides an open, generalisable structure for this mapping,  but there is still the work of agreeing on labels and meanings - taxonomies.

Taxononies can be developed organically, as part of improving contract efficiency.  Prose Objects provide a mechanical and crowd-sourced approach to agree on labels and meanings.  The structured information and shared components make contract drafting and negotiation easier, better, faster, more cooperative, and the best format for managing these is to maintain them as objects in a graph.  So we expect party-based negotiation to generate common taxonomies.

But it is also very effective to work from the top down, to create or adopt standard taxonomies.  There is a vast body of standards work that can be included, some of which have extensive histories.  The graph will pull them together, into a common gravitational field, converging.

Elements of Contracts versus Annotations

Note that there are two kinds of taxonomies - those that are elements of contracts and those that annotate them.  For instance, a taxonomy of persons - natural and legal - is a necessary part of a contract graph.  Contracts are among persons, information about persons - names, addresses, representatives, etc. - is included in contracts.  But the type of legal matter or phase of a contract are not included in the text.  A transaction can be labelled as involving IP or the energy industry, but that is not part of the text of the contract or any of the related interactions.  Similarly, "in dispute" or "in litigation" are not a part of the text, but rather a conclusion that can be added as a label (or drawn from subsequent nodes in the graph).  A graph permits an unlimited number of annotation systems and unlimited number of annotators, without conflict.  There can also be multiple taxonomies for the essential elements, but there is strong reason to standardise them.

Model Forms as Taxonomies

Model forms of contracts or components also are taxonomies.  They map a label (the name of the contract) to a meaning (the content of the contract).  They often also provide internal taxonomies - the names of the sections and subsections.  Model forms may be casual or confused in their labelling, but can be extremely helpful in their content (meaning).

With that as prelude, here are some existing taxonomies and standards.

Elemental Taxonomies:

The essential categories are: Parameter names, Persons, Places (addresses), Assets, Forms and their components - sections and subsections.

Note that this excludes some information that is crucial to real life and contract performance - for instance where at sea a ship is, or the temperature of a container.  These can be included as data sources -  blockchain communities sometimes call these oracles, and IoT groups work on standards for them.

Note that this also does not include standards for data interactions.  These, too, are crucial for an ecosystem of contracts, for instance among financial institutions under the Payment Services Directive, for data portability under the GDPR, and for a secure IoT.
