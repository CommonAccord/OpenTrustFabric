Ti=This is a home for materials relating to the "Open Trust Fabric."

1.sec=The goal of the OTF is to promote a system of transacting and relationships that is open, secure, data-minimizing and democratic.

2.sec=We believe that such a system is the common destination of efforts that range from open source coding and blockchains to legal codification.  The EU's GDPR and Payment Services Directive are driving forces for an Open Trust Fabric.

3.sec=This effort is made in connection with a contract from the EU Commission on "Modelling the EU Economy as an Ecosystem of Contracts." (We'll call this the EU Contract.")

4.sec=We are inspired by work to give people control over their own data, and the theories of "<a href="http://socialphysics.media.mit.edu/">Social Physics</a>".

5.sec=Business contracting is a particularly fertile field for work as business contracts fall into clear patterns, are linked into transnational supply chains, and businesses have resources to apply to the effort.  The IACCM.com is a forum for business efforts and a supporter of the EU Contract.

6.sec=We believe that it is particularly impactful to focus on legal document standards as part of the ecosystem of contracts because they are a place where enormous improvements can be made using methods already proven in the spheres of law and software coding.

7.sec=In other words, the OTF seeks to encourage cross-fertilization among various actors working to improve transacting, governanace, security and autonomy.
