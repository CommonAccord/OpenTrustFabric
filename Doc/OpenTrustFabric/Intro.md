Ti=This is a home for materials relating to the "Open Trust Fabric."

1.sec=The goal of the OTF is to promote a system of transacting and relationships that is open, secure, data-minimizing and democratic.

2.sec=We believe that such a system is the common destination of efforts that range from open source coding and blockchains to legal codification.  Driving forces for this include enterprise management, security concerns reflected in the EU's GDPR and Payment Services Directive, democratic deficit, and the blockchain movement.

3.sec=This OTF effort is made in connection with a contract from the EU Commission on "<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/item-detail.cfm?item_id=638348">Modelling the EU Economy as an Ecosystem of Contracts</a>." (We'll call this the EU Contract.")

4.sec=We are inspired by work to give people control over their own data, and the theories of "<a href="http://socialphysics.media.mit.edu/">Social Physics</a>".

5.sec=Business contracting is a particularly fertile field for work as business contracts fall into clear patterns, are linked into transnational supply chains, and businesses have resources to apply to the effort.  The <a href="http://iaccm.com">IACCM.com</a> is a forum for business efforts and a supporter of the EU Contract.

6.sec=We believe that it is particularly impactful to focus on the "patterns" of contracting, because these patterns are both descriptive and generative.  That is, they can be the basis for better transacting as well as tools for understanding existing contracts.  The blizzard of modern forms and interfaces, clicks to consent, report formats and data collections masks the fact that most of transacting falls into patterns.  "Patterns" include legal language, code functions, transaction mechanics and relationship goals.  At an even higher level, they include "business models" - a function that a person performs for others - such as restauranteur, food processor, grocer, wholesaler, transporter or farmer.  It should be possible for a person to "instantiate" a business model and have that fit in a supply chain as part of the ecosystem of contracts.

7.sec=Most of this work has already been done, indeed done many times over, by private parties and suppliers of software and related systems.  An "ecosystem" approach aims to create bridges among these silos - to fluidify solutions via open source - for the benefit of the users, businesses, consumers, citizens and their collective institutions.

8.sec=Legal document standards may play a catalyzing role.  Legal documents are the hard-tissue of an ecosystem of contracts, and enormous improvements can be made quite directly, using methods already proven in law and software coding.

9.sec=In other words, the OTF seeks to encourage cross-fertilization among actors working to improve transacting, governance, security and autonomy.
