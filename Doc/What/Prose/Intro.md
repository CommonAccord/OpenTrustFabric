Template Libraries:

Assuming a Ricardian model of Code and Prose, libraries of templates will provide the Prose.  Important issues include where those libraries will be hosted, who will provide them, how will they be maintained.  Here are a few thoughts.

There are currently vast resources of document templates and clause libraries.  The great majority of these are in law firms, but commercial publishers also have extensive offerings, trade groups sometimes have sets for their industries, organizations often have preferred or required forms and sometimes legislation dictates a form or formulation.  These libraries of templates are organized in various formats.  The great majority are simply Word precedents, often as prior usage and sometimes as forms - the text with blanks or parameters for information.

But there are also more systematic organizations, including formal clause libraries and document assembly sources.  NLP systems can now do a good job of converting unstructured precedents into structured forms and clause libraries.

At the most abstract level, there are taxonomies that purport to be complete, such as ISO-LEI and ACTUS.

In an ecosystem of contracts, these standards are obviously helpful - they reflect both serious work and the existence of a community of interest.  What is the future of these various taxonomies and systems of templates?  For interoperability, they must  convergence.

(NOTE: merely bullet points now.)

This provides a list.

Form Templates will be made of subcomponents:

Differences will be expressed as overrides:

Use cases will be packaged as sets of differences

Git will be the platform for collaboration:

Git repos wlll be maintained by various groups.
