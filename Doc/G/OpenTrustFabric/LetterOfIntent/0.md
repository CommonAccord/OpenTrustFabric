Ti=Alliance for an Open Trust Fabric

0.0.sec=An open ecosystem of trusted, modular legal artifacts, expressing agreed terms, and related protocols for transacting, managing knowledge, data, contracting, law and policy development.

0.1.sec=Initiative proposed by

0.2.sec=initiative endorsed by IACCM (TBC), Lexpert (TBC), Ordine dei Commercialisti di Roma (TBC) 

 
1.Ti=Background and Purpose

1.1.sec=“We are moving from the old ways of measuring and reporting growth based on making and selling things (i.e., physical capital), to today’s growth drivers of developing and creating human, intellectual, and network capital. 

1.2.sec=Our research into business models clearly indicates a world where networks and digital assets are more valuable than things and “access” is more important than ownership. In the process of creating more efficient, happy, and technologically supported lives, we may have to blow up and recreate how we gauge economic prosperity and growth.”

1.3.sec=Many of the economic world Leaders are declaring our societies are moving towards the Fourth Industrial Revolution where information is spreading fast, real time data sources are more available, innovations are becoming faster, efficient accessible than ever before and economic systems are becoming more and more interconnected. Technology is making possible for the first time the convergence of the digital, physical and biological realms.

1.4.sec=In this context, challenges to legal systems and governance are growing as the world economy is becoming ever more connected, global and automated, empowered by the usage of pervasive IT infrastructures and systems running global processes, executing services across national boundaries, transferring economic data and financial transactions.

1.5.sec=The speed and velocity of economic cycles, secured by current legal systems, is suffering from the usage of slow legal practises and low-tech methods, creating bottlenecks to economic processes and allowing unknown risks to develop.  Traditional legal processes lag behind today’s virtualisation/tokenization of the economic system, trading and operational practices.  The technology has run faster than the law, the original warning in Professor Lawrence Lessig’s “Code is Law”.

1.6.sec=In some cases, the contractual and legal frameworks have been updated (for example with the creation of Digital Rights Management to protect IP and control usage or Software-as-a-Service distribution models that are replacing software licencing approaches). New trading and operational models have been created to respond to this challenge. But it has not been enough.

1.7.sec=Legal systems should be updated to facilitate economic growth and transfer of value in our interconnected societies. Contracts and legal procedures should become smart, adaptive and responsive, and their direct contribution, in terms of process improvement, should become more clear and measurable, not only during the formation of the agreement but also during its execution.  Contracts should reduce risks, make the risks more visible, and make dispute resolution (including litigation) more rapid, predictable and efficient, both in costs (including legal fees) as well as the opportunity cost of lengthy procedures. 

1.8.sec=Although legal professionals are surrounded by digital information and software tools, the way they codify and represent contracts is still limited by the first wave of word processing tools that limit the possibility to represent digital knowledge and embed data, connected to accounting principles and procedures. The digitization of information, the possibility to bring automation into decision making processes, the incorporation of legal rules into code and the emergence of regulation by code could favour a paradigm shift to eliminate barriers for making legal constructs more effective and predictable. 

1.9.sec=Opaque and ineffective legal document practices are responsible for a very large part of the cost of doing business, the opacity of governments, hidden systemic risks and the trend toward gigantism and winner-take-most in online business. Nearly all of the inefficiency, costs and opacity of forming and managing legal relationships can be eliminated by adopting practices that are already well-established in the open source software community. Software engineers have perfected these methods for their own use; lawyers can adopt and adapt them.  

1.10.sec=Similarly, the clarity and certainty of legal arrangements can be radically increased by “codification” of legal documents.  Codification is perhaps the most ancient and effective legal method for increasing clarity and certainty, from Hammurabi and the Napoleonic Code to INCO terms.  From “my” forms of businesses and agencies to model documents, industry standards and legislation, codification promotes clarity and stability.  These various forms of codification can be integrated into a single system as open source templates.  The templates can be commented, rated and annotated like legal codes.  They can also be adapted (“forked”) and integrated (“merged”) in a transparent, on-going process.

1.11.sec=Technology trends put increasing focus on the importance of legal templates.  A vast multiplicity of solutions exist and new ones are being proposed to improve automation of transacting, from legal aid “bots” to court interfaces, contract management and vendor management, to smart contracts and blockchains. Each has its idiosyncrasies, and each depends on standardising legal text.  

1.12.sec=A simple, general approach can unify all of these efforts around the shared necessity of legal text that frames transactions.  The approach can work with conventional legal document practices of word processing, with corporate systems of contract management and with new blockchain systems of smart contracts.
There is a need for public-interest curation of templates for this new form of legal codification.  There are a series of dangers to be avoided or managed relating to legal forms, including fraudulent or low-quality solutions; substantive domination by particular interest groups; and disenfranchisement of smaller communities and jurisdictions.

1.13.sec=In parallel, economic measurement approaches, particularly Gross Domestic Product (GDP), struggle to account for today’s intangible assets—services, insights, and networks. This is not merely because the way of measuring GDP and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are no longer adequate methods for measuring economic growth. Those methodologies need to be updated to reflect new contract structures that could facilitate and make measurable and visible the way networks and intangible assets and data should be correctly accounted in a computable, standards-based ledger of value.

2.Ti=Goals

2.1.sec=The aim of the OPEN TRUST FABRIC alliance is to create an open and inclusive ecosystem of contributors who will demonstrate an innovative approach for both reporting the economy as an ecosystem of contracts and actually implementing it, connecting the legal, accounting and business functions into a united system, interfacing between these three worlds.  

2.2.sec=The global community will provide a clear vision of the convergence of economy, law and code, and the representation of the global economy as an ecosystem of contracts. 

2.3.sec=The OPEN TRUST FABRIC alliance will map current contracts and data linked in a way that facilitates a new approach to regulation, which involves an increasing use of software code and code-ified law. We will begin by placing law in the context of transacting.

2.4.sec=The approach is similar to those that leading-edge enterprises are beginning to adopt – a “graph” of semantically-labelled data, organised into secure “data lakes,” with cryptographic access control and assurances of coherence across suppliers, customers, managers and regulators, based on standards and open source software. In essence, we will demonstrate that entire economies can be modelled in the way that leading enterprises are modelling their own commercial relationships. We will also demonstrate data minimization approaches that will enable a more robust, secure, localised solution to online transacting and “trust,” consistent with the EU GDPR objectives an initiatives such as the “Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace”. 

2.5.sec=We will capture and communicate interoperability requirements and issues, and document usage-related operational constraints, standards and virtualization issues associated with contracts and seek to identify opportunities for consolidation and standardization that could facilitate operational modelling, framework adoption and improvement in contracting.

2.6.sec=We will jointly create an open innovative repository based on a set of community-driven Web tools to promote the vision of available contract ecosystem "as a living organism." A part of maintaining robustness is keeping the tools simple and open source so that autonomy and diversity can be maintained.  Ideally, the efficiency will be realized from grass-roots use (technically, the “edge”).  That is one of the advantages of focusing on tools that let people write and manage conventional contract documents more efficiently.  This approach is focused on the “parameters” and “prose” elements of “Ricardian Contracts.”
